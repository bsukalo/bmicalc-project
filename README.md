Nejra Mujezinović, Hamza Hadžiabdić, Benjamin Šukalo

A BMI calculator is a tool used for calculating one's body mass index. This project will feature scripts made in Python, C#, and JavaScript, which will all serve the same purpose - calculating a person's BMI based off of data provided by the user using either the Imperial or metric system, per the user's choice.
